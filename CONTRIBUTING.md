Contributing
============

Thanks for your interest! This is a small demo project. If you'd like to contribute:

- Open an issue describing the bug or feature.
- Send a PR against `main` with small, focused changes.
- Keep the single-file program behaviour unchanged unless you document the rationale.
- Add tests where appropriate (unit tests or small smoke tests).

Coding style
- Prefer simple, portable C++17 and avoid platform-specific headers where possible.

License
- By contributing, you agree to license contributions under the project's MIT license.
